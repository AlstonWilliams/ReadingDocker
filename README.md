## ReadingDocker
================

Well, I'm reading the source code of docker now, and maybe you also do it now. Otherwise how you can see this project.

You know, reading code is a difficult but awesome progress. We absorb the marrow of great project, we understand the idea behind the project. Then we know how to design one which is similar to it by ourself.

We have to add comment in the code, it helps us remember our opinions. And we build the structure by these comments.

so, my opinions is documented by comments.

I have divided the comments to two categories. The first one which I understand is represents by '// Reading: ' or '/*Reading:*/', and second one which I have no idea is represents by '// NoIdea:' or '/*NoIdea:*/' in comments.

Oh, you should remember this explanation if based on docker 1.12.x. And there are some differences between different version.
